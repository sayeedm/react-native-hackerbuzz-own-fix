# HackerBuzz-ReactNative

Over the past few months, I've been working on a side project to gain an understanding of the React Native workflow. I decided to create a Hacker News reader using [Y Combinator's API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

### Available for iOS on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/hacker-buzz/id1292825792?mt=8) and Android on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hackerbuzz)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `$ cd HackerBuzz-ReactNative`
3. Run either `$ yarn install` or `$ npm install`

I used the [Facebook Audience Network](https://developers.facebook.com/products/audience-network/overview/) in order to display advertisements _every 20 stories_. As a result, you need to make sure that the SDK is properly installed or else the project won't build.

### iOS
1. Make sure that cocoapods are installed
   - `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`
2. `$ pod install`
3. Open `HackerBuzz.xcworkspace`
4. Modify `jsCodeLocation` to point to your IP address in `AppDelegate.m`
6. If you wish display ads, make sure that you create a placement within the Facebook Developer console or else they won't appear.
   - [Getting Started with the Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/#settings)
   - [Getting Started with The Facebook Audience Network](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network)
   - Modify `kFacebookAdPlacementId` within `StoryListAd.m`
7. Run via XCode or `$ react-native run-ios`

### Android

1. Build the Android project
2. Add the Facebook SDK to the project [as per these instructions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/#sdk-project)
3. If you wish display ads, make sure that you create a placement within the Facebook Developer console or else they won't appear.
   - [Getting Started with the Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/#settings)
   - [Getting Started with The Facebook Audience Network](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network)
   - Modify `PLACEMENT_ID` within `RNTNativeAdManager.java`
4. Run via Android Studio

## Testing

The project currently contains test for the actions and reducers within `/js/__tests__/`. Mocks are located within `js/__mocks__/` In order to execute these tests, run `$ npm test`.
